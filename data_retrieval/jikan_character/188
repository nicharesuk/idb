{"about": "Age: 15-16\n Height: 159 cm\n Weight: 46 kg\n BWH: 83-55-82\n Relations: Haruko Kamio (aunt, foster mother then adopted) and Kannabi no Mikoto/Kanna (incarnation)\n Favorite animal: dinosaur\n Favorite phrase: \"Gao\" (noise of a dinosaur)\n Favorite drink: peach pulp juice\n \n Misuzu Kamio is a slightly strange girl that is first introduced when she meets Yukito Kunisaki. With an obsession with dinosaurs (which goes back to her childhood), she finds it difficult to make friends and is constantly left alone. Because of Misuzu's fondness of dinosaurs, she uses the word \"Gao\" frequently, which is the noise she thought dinosaurs made when she was young. Even though Misuzu's foster mother scolds her whenever she utters it, Misuzu constantly disregards the warning and continues using it in her everyday speech.\n \n One day, Misuzu resolves to make a friend, and after meeting Yukito, invites him over to dinner. Although Haruko disapproves of him at first, they all eventually become friends and Yukito is invited to stay. While playing cards one night, Misuzu suddenly cries without reason. Haruko soon explains that Misuzu has a condition where she cries uncontrollably when she comes close to making friends. Haruko brought her to a clinic and to a big hospital hoping it would help, but it didn't work. It was a mental instability, but the doctors said she would slowly recover as she got older. Misuzu's condition begins to worsen, prompting Yukito to leave. He soon discovers that Misuzu is related to a childhood tale he heard, and that she is the descendant of the Winged-Maiden in the tale, who has been cursed to eternal pain.\n \n Misuzu soon becomes ill; she becomes childlike and has to use a wheelchair. As a result, Haruko tries to adopt Misuzu officially. Unfortunately, before she is able to do so, Misuzu's biological father comes to take her with him; however, when he tries to leave with her, Misuzu refuses, calling Haruko \"Mama.\"\n \n Even though Misuzu stays with Haruko, her condition doesn't improve, and when Yukito returns, she is in constant pain. In the final episode, Misuzu asks that they all go to the beach together and when they get there, Misuzu attempts to walk to Haruko and Yukito, calling them \"her goal.\" Sadly, when Misuzu does reach them, she collapses and dies in Haruko's arms, ending the curse placed on the Winged Maiden.\n (Source: MAL Rewrite)\n\n", "name": "Misuzu Kamio", "image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/12/121658.jpg", "mangaography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/3/28956.jpg?s=a32e3fa61b9eb5810677403b764e7bb2", "link": "/manga/1604/Air", "name": "Air"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/manga/1/4819.jpg?s=5e87c90cbea001379da0e53bf3a79f9c", "link": "/manga/4152/Kanon___Air__Sky", "name": "Kanon & Air: Sky"}], "member-favorites": 1032, "animeography": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/8/22059.jpg?s=c3e47d4cef7873bdfc63c36bbe776044", "link": "/anime/101/Air", "name": "Air"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/r/23x32/images/anime/10/26507.jpg?s=3518206620f69c8ac073f1729031ba44", "link": "/anime/713/Air_Movie", "name": "Air Movie"}], "name-japanese": "(\u795e\u5c3e\u89b3\u9234)", "voice-actors": [{"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/1/10138v.jpg", "link": "/people/71/Tomoko_Kawakami", "name": "Kawakami, Tomoko", "language": "Japanese"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/37923v.jpg", "link": "/people/159/Monica_Rial", "name": "Rial, Monica", "language": "English"}, {"image": "https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/voiceactors/2/15621v.jpg", "link": "/people/14921/Seon_Yeong_Park", "name": "Park, Seon Yeong", "language": "Korean"}]}
